This course provided me with a soid foundation in the pandas library. The pandas library is vast, with many more tools and functions to be discovered for sophisticated data analyses. The next steps are to work on a project involving real data using pandas, not just to solidify understanding, but to further expand my knowledge and skillset on this awesome library.
